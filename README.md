<h1>BullyProof</h1>
<p><strong>University of Makati</strong> recognizes the critical importance of creating a safe digital environment for its academic community. As cyberbullying becomes increasingly prevalent in educational institutions, UMAK requires effective tools to identify, report, and address these incidents while maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality and support for affected individuals.</p>
<p>The university's commitment to student and employee welfare extends to digital spaces, requiring a robust system that can handle incident reporting, automated classification, and comprehensive case management while ensuring accessibility and user-friendly operations across the entire university community.</p>
<p>This comprehensive mobile application was developed to combat cyberbullying within the University of Makati community by providing a secure and efficient incident reporting system. The app leverages machine learning technology, specifically a <strong>Logistic Regression Algorithm</strong>, to automatically classify reported incidents based on content analysis of both English and Tagalog phrases, fostering a safe and supportive environment for all community members.</p>
